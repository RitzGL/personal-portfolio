                <p>
                    Hello, welcome. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My name is Maurizio (Ritz), and this page was designed
                    and launched by me. Here's some info on me.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    I obtained a bachelor's degree
                    in Cognitive Neuroscience and Health Psychology at Murdoch
                    University in 2019. I am currently enrolled in a bachelor's for 
                    Computer Science, expecting to complete it by 2023. My goal
                    is to transition into a role within the technology industry, 
                    preferably as a full-time developer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As part of my passion for technology, I enrolled in Full Stack 
                    Web Development Bootcamp, where I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    and soon will be learning more back-end development. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of my first full front-end projects is this page you are 
                    looking at right now. In this page, I have implemented several
                    different techniques to manipulate the layout of all these 
                    elements. It has been challenging and time-consuming, however,
                    this task has allowed me to improve my designing abilities.
